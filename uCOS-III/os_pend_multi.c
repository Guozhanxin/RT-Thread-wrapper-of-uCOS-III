*                                               PEND ON MULTIPLE OBJECTS
*
* Description: This function pends on multiple objects.  The objects pended on MUST be either semaphores or message
*              queues.  If multiple objects are ready at the start of the pend call, then all available objects that
*              are ready will be indicated to the caller.  If the task must pend on the multiple events then, as soon
*              as one of the object is either posted, aborted or deleted, the task will be readied.
*
*              This function only allows you to pend on semaphores and/or message queues.
*
* Arguments  : p_pend_data_tbl   is a pointer to an array of type OS_PEND_DATA which contains a list of all the
*                                objects we will be waiting on.  The caller must declare an array of OS_PEND_DATA
*                                and initialize the .PendObjPtr (see below) with a pointer to the object (semaphore or
*                                message queue) to pend on.
*

*
*                                The OS_PEND_DATA field are as follows:
*

*                                    OS_PEND_DATA  *NextPtr;      Used to link OS_PEND_DATA objects
*                                    OS_TCB        *TCBPtr;       Pointer to the TCB that is pending on multiple objects
*                                    OS_PEND_OBJ   *PendObjPtr;   USER supplied field which is a pointer to the
*                                                                 semaphore or message queue you want to pend on.  When
*                                                                 you call OSPendMulti() you MUST fill this field for

*                                    OS_PEND_OBJ   *RdyObjPtr;    OSPendMulti() will return the object that was posted,
*                                                                 aborted or deleted in this field.
*                                    void          *RdyMsgPtr;    OSPendMulti() will fill in this field if the object

*                                    CPU_TS         RdyTS;        OSPendMulti() will fill in this field if the object

*
*              tbl_size      is the size (in number of elements) of the OS_PEND_DATA array passed to this function.  In
*                            other words, if the called needs to pend on 4 separate objects (semaphores and/or queues)
*                            then you would pass 4 to this call.
*
*              timeout       is an optional timeout period (in clock ticks).  If non-zero, your task will wait any of
*                            the objects up to the amount of time specified by this argument. If you specify 0, however,
*                            your task will wait forever for the specified objects or, until an object is posted,
*                            aborted or deleted.
*
*              opt           determines whether the user wants to block if none of the objects are available.

*                                                         for which objects were aborted.
*                                OS_ERR_PEND_DEL          The wait on the events was aborted; check the .RdyObjPtr fields
*                                                         for which objects were aborted.
*                                OS_ERR_PEND_ISR          If you called this function from an ISR

*                                OS_ERR_STATUS_INVALID    Invalid pend status
*                                OS_ERR_PTR_INVALID       If you passes a NULL pointer of 'p_pend_data_tbl'
